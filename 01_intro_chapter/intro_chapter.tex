\section{MIMO Challenges}

Modern Multiple-Input-Multiple-Output (MIMO) systems face many challenges in the distributed landscape. Talk about interference, noise, multipath, path loss at mmWave etc. the claim in this cited paper is that adaptive beamforming will be necessary to practically scale out next generation MIMO systems\citep{6732923}

\section{Embedded Processing Challenges}

Introduce how array processing grows with antenna count, makes it difficult for processing on edge devices.
