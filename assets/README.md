## LibreOffice Draw Figure Export to LaTeX

Figures can be exported in many traditional file formats- as well as vector image formats like `*.eps`- from LibreOffice Draw file `diagrams.odg` by doing:
1. Check `Tools > Options > LibreOffice > General > Open/Save Dialogs > Use LibreOffice dialogs`.
2. Select all, or part, of your diagram to export.
3. `File > Export` can then be used to export the given selection to a certain file name, location and file type.
